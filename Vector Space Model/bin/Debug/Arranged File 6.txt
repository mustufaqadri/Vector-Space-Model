own early days i often borrowed money was not very particular about it borrowed wherever i could but nothing world would induced me borrow from luganovitchs but why talk it i was unhappy home fields barn i thought i tried understand mystery beautiful intelligent young woman s marrying some one so uninteresting almost an old man husband was over forty having children by him understand mystery this uninteresting good simple hearted man who argued with such wearisome good sense balls evening parties kept near more solid people looking listless superfluous with submissive uninterested expression though he been brought there sale who yet believed right happy children by i kept trying understand why she met him first not me why such terrible mistake our lives need happened when i went town i saw every time from eyes that she was expecting me she would confess me herself that she peculiar feeling that day guessed that i should come talked long time were silent yet did not confess our love each other but timidly jealously concealed it were afraid everything that might reveal our secret ourselves i loved tenderly deeply but i reflected kept asking myself what our love could lead if not strength fight against it it seemed incredible that my gentle sad love could coarsely break even tenor life husband children household which i was so loved trusted would it honourable she would go away with me but where where could i take it would been different matter if i beautiful interesting life if instance i been struggling emancipation my country or been celebrated man science an artist or painter but it was it would mean taking from one everyday humdrum life another humdrum or perhaps more so how long would our happiness last what would happen case i was ill case i died or if simply grew cold one another she apparently reasoned same way she thought husband children mother who loved husband like son if she abandoned herself feelings she would lie or else tell truth position either would been equally terrible inconvenient she was tormented by question whether love would bring me happiness would she not complicate my life which it was was hard enough full sorts trouble she fancied she was not young enough me that she was not industrious nor energetic enough begin new life she often talked husband importance my marrying girl intelligence merit who would capable housewife help me she would immediately add that it would difficult find such girl whole town meanwhile years were passing anna alexyevna already two children when i arrived luganovitchs servants smiled cordially children shouted that uncle pavel konstantinovitch come hung my neck every one was overjoyed they did not understand what was passing my soul thought that i too was happy every one looked me noble being grown ups children alike felt that noble being was walking about their rooms that gave peculiar charm their manner towards me though my presence their life too was purer more beautiful anna alexyevna i used go theatre together always walking there used sit side by side stalls our shoulders touching i would take opera glass from hands without word feel that minute that she was near me that she was mine that could not live without each other but by some strange misunderstanding when came out theatre always said good bye parted though were strangers goodness knows what people were saying about us town already but there was not word truth it latter years anna alexyevna took going away frequent visits mother or sister she began suffer from low spirits she began recognize that life was spoilt unsatisfied times she did not care see husband nor children she was already being treated neurasthenia were silent still silent presence outsiders she displayed strange irritation regard me whatever i talked about she disagreed with me if i an argument she sided with my opponent if i dropped anything she would say coldly i congratulate you if i forgot take opera glass when were going theatre she would say afterwards i knew you would forget it luckily or unluckily there nothing our lives that does not end sooner or later time parting came luganovitch was appointed president one western provinces they sell their furniture their horses their summer villa when they drove out villa afterwards looked back they were going away look last time garden green roof every one was sad i realized that i say goodbye not only villa it was arranged that end august should see anna alexyevna off crimea where doctors were sending that little later luganovitch children would set off western province were great crowd see anna alexyevna off when she said good bye husband children there was only minute left before third bell i ran into compartment put basket which she almost forgotten rack i say good bye when our eyes met compartment our spiritual fortitude deserted us both i took my arms she pressed face my breast tears flowed from eyes kissing face shoulders hands wet with tears oh how unhappy were i confessed my love with burning pain my heart i realized how unnecessary how petty how deceptive that hindered us from loving was i understood that when you love you must either your reasonings about that love start from what highest from what more important than happiness or unhappiness sin or virtue their accepted meaning or you must not reason i kissed last time pressed hand parted ever train already started i went into next compartment it was empty until i reached next station i sat there crying then i walked home sofino while alehin was telling story rain left off sun came out burkin ivan ivanovitch went out balcony from which there was beautiful view over garden mill pond which was shining now sunshine like mirror they admired it same time they were sorry that this man with kind clever eyes who told them this story with such genuine feeling should rushing round round this huge estate like squirrel wheel instead devoting himself science or something else which would made life more pleasant they thought what sorrowful face anna alexyevna must when he said good bye railway carriage kissed face shoulders both them met town burkin knew thought beautiful
