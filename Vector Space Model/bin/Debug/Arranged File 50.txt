arguments seemed rather spring bosom auditor than suggested by himself they went he plucked branch maple serve walking stick began strip it twigs little boughs which were wet with evening dew moment fingers touched them they became strangely withered dried with week s sunshine thus pair proceeded good free pace until suddenly gloomy hollow road goodman brown sat himself down stump tree refused go

he threw companion maple stick was speedily out sight if he vanished into deepening gloom young man sat few moments by roadside applauding himself greatly thinking with how clear conscience he should meet minister morning walk nor shrink from eye good old deacon gookin what calm sleep would that very night which was been spent so wickedly but so purely sweetly now arms faith amidst these pleasant praiseworthy meditations goodman brown heard tramp horses along road deemed it advisable conceal himself within verge forest conscious guilty purpose that brought him thither though now so happily turned from it came hoof tramps voices riders two grave old voices conversing soberly they drew near these mingled sounds appeared pass along road within few yards young man s hiding place but owing doubtless depth gloom that particular spot neither travellers nor their steeds were visible though their figures brushed small boughs by wayside it could not seen that they intercepted even moment faint gleam from strip bright sky athwart which they must passed goodman brown alternately crouched stood tiptoe pulling aside branches thrusting forth head far he durst without discerning so much shadow it vexed him more because he could sworn were such thing possible that he recognized voices minister deacon gookin jogging along quietly they were wont when bound some ordination or ecclesiastical council while yet within hearing one riders stopped pluck switch two reverend sir said voice like deacon s i rather miss an ordination dinner than night s meeting they tell me that some our community here from falmouth beyond others from connecticut rhode island besides several indian powwows who after their fashion know almost much deviltry best us moreover there goodly young woman taken into communion mighty well deacon gookin replied solemn old tones minister spur or shall late nothing done you know until i get ground hoofs clattered again voices talking so strangely empty air passed through forest where church ever been gathered or solitary christian prayed whither then could these holy men journeying so deep into heathen wilderness young goodman brown caught hold tree support being ready sink down ground faint overburdened with heavy sickness heart he looked sky doubting whether there really was heaven above him yet there was blue arch stars brightening it with heaven above faith below i will yet stand firm against devil cried goodman brown while he still gazed upward into deep arch firmament lifted hands pray cloud though wind was stirring hurried across zenith hid brightening stars blue sky was still visible except directly overhead where this black mass cloud was sweeping swiftly northward aloft air if from depths cloud came confused doubtful sound voices listener fancied that he could distinguish accents towns people own men women both pious ungodly many whom he met communion table seen others rioting tavern next moment so indistinct were sounds he doubted whether he heard aught but murmur old forest whispering without wind then came stronger swell those familiar tones heard daily sunshine salem village but never until now from cloud night there was one voice young woman uttering lamentations yet with an uncertain sorrow entreating some favor which perhaps it would grieve obtain unseen multitude both saints sinners seemed encourage onward faith shouted goodman brown voice agony desperation echoes forest mocked him crying faith faith if bewildered wretches were seeking through wilderness cry grief rage terror was yet piercing night when unhappy husband held breath response there was scream drowned immediately louder murmur voices fading into far off laughter dark cloud swept away leaving clear silent sky above goodman brown but something fluttered lightly down through air caught branch tree young man seized it beheld pink ribbon my faith gone cried he after one stupefied moment there good earth sin but name come devil thee this world given maddened with despair so that he laughed loud long did goodman brown grasp staff set forth again such rate that he seemed fly along forest path rather than walk or run road grew wilder drearier more faintly traced vanished length leaving him heart dark wilderness still rushing onward with instinct that guides mortal man evil whole forest was peopled with frightful sounds creaking trees howling wild beasts yell indians while sometimes wind tolled like distant church bell sometimes gave broad roar around traveller if nature were laughing him scorn but he was himself chief horror scene shrank not from its other horrors ha ha ha roared goodman brown when wind laughed him let us hear which will laugh loudest think not frighten me with your deviltry come witch come wizard come indian powwow come devil himself here comes goodman brown you may well fear him he fear you truth through haunted forest there could nothing more frightful than figure goodman brown he flew among black pines brandishing staff with frenzied gestures now giving vent an inspiration horrid blasphemy now shouting forth such laughter set echoes forest laughing like demons around him fiend own shape less hideous than when he rages breast man thus sped demoniac course until quivering among trees he saw red light before him when felled trunks branches clearing been set fire throw their lurid blaze against sky hour midnight he paused lull tempest that driven him onward heard swell what seemed hymn rolling solemnly from distance with weight many voices he knew tune it was familiar one choir village meetinghouse verse died heavily away was lengthened by chorus not human voices but sounds benighted wilderness pealing awful harmony together goodman brown cried out cry was lost own ear by its unison with cry desert interval silence he stole forward until light glared full upon eyes one extremity an open space hemmed by dark wall forest arose rock bearing some rude natural resemblance either an altar or pulpit surrounded by four blazing pines their tops aflame their stems untouched like candles an evening meeting mass foliage that overgrown summit rock was fire blazing high into night fitfully illuminating whole field each pendent twig leafy festoon was blaze red light arose fell numerous congregation alternately shone forth then disappeared shadow again grew it were out darkness peopling heart solitary woods grave dark clad company quoth goodman brown truth they were such among them quivering fro between gloom splendor appeared faces that would seen next day council board province others which sabbath after sabbath looked devoutly heavenward benignantly over crowded pews from holiest pulpits land some affirm that lady governor was there least there were high dames well known wives honored husbands widows great multitude ancient maidens excellent repute fair young girls who trembled lest their mothers should espy them either sudden gleams light flashing over obscure field bedazzled goodman brown or he recognized score church members salem village famous their especial sanctity good old deacon gookin arrived waited skirts that venerable saint revered pastor but irreverently consorting with these grave reputable pious people these elders church these chaste dames dewy virgins there were men dissolute lives women spotted fame wretches given over mean filthy vice suspected even horrid crimes it was strange see that good shrank not from wicked nor were sinners abashed by saints scattered also among their pale faced enemies were indian priests or powwows who often scared their native forest with more hideous incantations than any known english witchcraft but where faith thought goodman brown hope came into heart he trembled another verse hymn arose slow mournful strain such pious love but joined words which expressed that our nature conceive sin darkly hinted far more unfathomable mere mortals lore fiends verse after verse was sung still chorus desert swelled between like deepest tone mighty organ with final peal that dreadful anthem there came sound if roaring wind rushing streams howling beasts every other voice unconcerted wilderness were mingling according with voice guilty man homage prince four blazing pines threw loftier flame obscurely discovered shapes visages horror smoke wreaths above impious assembly same moment fire rock shot redly forth formed glowing arch above its base where now appeared figure with reverence it spoken figure bore slight similitude both garb manner some grave divine new england churches bring forth converts cried voice that echoed through field rolled into forest word goodman brown stepped forth from shadow trees approached congregation with whom he felt loathful brotherhood by sympathy that was wicked heart he could well nigh sworn that shape own dead father beckoned him advance looking downward from smoke wreath while woman with dim features despair threw out hand warn him back was it mother but he power retreat one step nor resist even thought when minister good old deacon gookin seized arms led him blazing rock thither came also slender form veiled female led between goody cloyse that pious teacher catechism martha carrier who received devil s promise queen hell rampant hag was she there stood proselytes beneath canopy fire welcome my children said dark figure communion your race ye found thus young your nature your destiny my children look behind you they turned flashing forth it were sheet flame fiend worshippers were seen smile welcome gleamed darkly every visage there resumed sable form whom ye reverenced from youth ye deemed them holier than yourselves shrank from your own sin contrasting it with their lives righteousness prayerful aspirations heavenward yet here they my worshipping assembly this night it shall granted you know their secret deeds how hoary bearded elders church whispered wanton words young maids their households how many woman eager widows weeds given husband drink bedtime let him sleep last sleep bosom how beardless youths made haste inherit their fathers wealth how fair damsels blush not sweet

committed shall exult behold whole earth one stain guilt one mighty blood spot far more than this it shall yours penetrate every bosom deep mystery sin fountain wicked arts which inexhaustibly supplies more evil impulses than human power than my power its utmost make manifest deeds now my children look upon each other they did so by blaze hell kindled torches wretched man beheld faith wife husband trembling before that unhallowed altar lo there ye stand my children said figure deep solemn tone almost sad with its despairing awfulness if angelic nature could yet mourn our miserable race depending upon one another s hearts ye still hoped that virtue were not dream now ye undeceived evil nature mankind evil must your only happiness welcome again my children communion your race welcome repeated fiend worshippers one cry despair triumph there they stood only pair it seemed who were yet hesitating verge wickedness this dark world basin was hollowed naturally rock did it contain water reddened by lurid light or was it blood or perchance liquid flame herein did shape evil dip hand prepare lay mark baptism upon their foreheads that they might partakers mystery sin more conscious secret guilt others both deed thought than they could now their own husband cast one look pale wife faith him what polluted wretches would next glance show them each other shuddering alike what they disclosed what they saw faith faith cried husband look heaven resist wicked one whether faith obeyed he knew not hardly he spoken when he found himself amid calm night solitude listening roar wind which died heavily away through forest he staggered against rock felt it chill damp while hanging twig that been fire besprinkled cheek with coldest dew next morning young goodman brown came slowly into street salem village staring around him like bewildered man good old minister was taking walk along graveyard get an appetite breakfast meditate sermon bestowed blessing he passed goodman brown he shrank from venerable saint if avoid an anathema old deacon gookin was domestic worship holy words prayer were heard through open window what god cloth wizard pray quoth goodman brown goody cloyse that excellent old christian stood early sunshine own lattice catechizing little girl who brought pint morning s milk goodman brown snatched away child from grasp fiend himself turning corner by meetinghouse he spied head faith with pink ribbons gazing anxiously forth bursting into such joy sight him that she skipped along street almost kissed husband before whole village but goodman brown looked sternly sadly into face passed without greeting goodman brown fallen asleep forest only dreamed wild dream witch meeting it so if you will but alas it was dream evil omen young goodman brown stern sad darkly meditative distrustful if not desperate man did he become from night that fearful dream sabbath day when congregation were singing holy psalm he could not listen because an anthem sin rushed loudly upon ear drowned blessed strain when minister spoke from pulpit with power fervid eloquence with hand open bible sacred truths our religion saint like lives triumphant deaths future bliss or misery unutterable then did goodman brown turn pale dreading lest roof should thunder down upon gray blasphemer hearers often awaking suddenly midnight he shrank from bosom faith morning or eventide when family knelt down prayer he scowled muttered himself gazed sternly wife turned away when he lived long was borne grave hoary corpse followed by faith an aged woman children grandchildren goodly procession besides neighbors not few they carved hopeful verse upon tombstone dying hour was gloom
