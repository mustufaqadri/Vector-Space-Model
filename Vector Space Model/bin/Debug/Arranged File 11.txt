would tilt condemned man go down between two ties arrangement commended itself judgment simple effective face not been covered nor eyes bandaged he looked moment unsteadfast footing then let gaze wander swirling water stream racing madly beneath feet piece dancing driftwood caught attention eyes followed it down current how slowly it appeared move what sluggish stream he closed eyes order fix last thoughts upon wife children water touched gold by early sun brooding mists under banks some distance down stream fort soldiers piece drift distracted him now he became conscious new disturbance striking through thought dear ones was sound which he could neither ignore nor understand sharp distinct metallic percussion like stroke blacksmith s hammer upon anvil it same ringing quality he wondered what it was whether immeasurably distant or near by it seemed both its recurrence was regular but slow tolling death knell he awaited each stroke with impatience he knew not why apprehension intervals silence grew progressively longer delays became maddening with their greater infrequency sounds increased strength sharpness they hurt ear like thrust knife he feared he would shriek what he heard was ticking watch he unclosed eyes saw again water below him if i could free my hands he thought i might throw off noose spring into stream by diving i could evade bullets swimming vigorously reach bank take woods get away home my home thank god yet outside their lines my wife little ones still beyond invader s farthest advance these thoughts which here set down words were flashed into doomed man s brain rather than evolved from it captain nodded sergeant sergeant stepped aside ii an occurrence owl creek bridge farm hospitalitypeyton farquhar was well planter an old highly respected alabama family being slave owner like other slave owners politician he was naturally an original secessionist ardently devoted southern cause circumstances an imperious nature which it unnecessary relate here prevented him from taking service with gallant army that fought disastrous campaigns ending with fall corinth he chafed under inglorious restraint longing release energies larger life soldier opportunity distinction that opportunity he felt would come it comes war time meanwhile he did what he could service was too humble him perform aid south adventure too perilous him undertake if consistent with character civilian who was heart soldier who good faith without too much qualification assented least part frankly villainous dictum that fair love war one evening while farquhar wife were sitting rustic bench near entrance grounds gray clad soldier rode gate asked drink water mrs farquhar was only too happy serve him with own white hands while she was fetching water husband approached dusty horseman inquired eagerly news from front yanks repairing railroads said man getting ready another advance they reached owl creek bridge put it order built stockade north bank commandant issued an order which posted everywhere declaring that any civilian caught interfering with railroad its bridges tunnels or trains will summarily hanged i saw order how far it owl creek bridge farquhar asked about thirty miles there force this side creek only picket post half mile out railroad single sentinel this end bridge suppose man civilian student hanging should elude picket post perhaps get better sentinel said farquhar smiling what could he accomplish soldier reflected i was there month ago he replied i observed that flood last winter lodged great quantity driftwood against wooden pier this end bridge it now dry would burn like tow lady now brought water which soldier drank he thanked ceremoniously bowed husband rode away an hour later after nightfall he repassed plantation going northward direction from which he come he was federal scout iii peyton farquhar fell straight downward through bridge he lost consciousness was one already dead from this state he was awakened ages later it seemed him by pain sharp pressure upon throat followed by sense suffocation keen poignant agonies seemed shoot from neck downward through every fiber body limbs these pains appeared flash along well defined lines ramification beat with an inconceivably rapid periodicity they seemed like streams pulsating fire heating him an intolerable temperature head he was conscious nothing but feeling fulness congestion these sensations were unaccompanied by thought intellectual part nature was already effaced he power only feel feeling was torment he was conscious motion encompassed luminous cloud which he was now merely fiery heart without material substance he swung through unthinkable arcs oscillation like vast pendulum then with terrible suddenness light about him shot upward with noise loud splash frightful roaring was ears was cold dark power thought was restored he knew that rope broken he fallen into stream there was additional strangulation noose about neck was already suffocating him kept water from lungs die hanging bottom river idea seemed him ludicrous he opened eyes darkness saw above him gleam light but how distant how inaccessible he was still sinking light became fainter fainter until it was mere glimmer then it began grow brighten he knew that he was rising toward surface knew it with reluctance he was now very comfortable hanged drowned he thought that not so bad but i not wish shot i will not shot that not fair he was not conscious an effort but sharp pain wrist apprised him that he was trying free hands he gave struggle attention an idler might observe feat juggler without interest outcome what splendid effort what magnificent what superhuman strength ah that was fine endeavor bravo cord fell away arms parted floated upward hands dimly seen each side growing light he watched them with new interest first one then other pounced upon noose neck they tore it away thrust it fiercely aside its undulations resembling those water snake put it back put it back he thought he shouted these words hands undoing noose been succeeded by direst pang that he yet experienced neck ached horribly brain was fire heart which been fluttering faintly gave great leap trying force itself out mouth whole body was racked wrenched with an insupportable anguish but disobedient hands gave heed command they beat water vigorously with quick downward strokes forcing him surface he felt head emerge eyes were blinded by sunlight chest expanded convulsively with supreme crowning agony lungs engulfed great draught air which instantly he expelled shriek he was now full possession physical senses they were indeed preternaturally keen alert something awful disturbance organic system so exalted refined them that they made record things never before perceived he felt ripples upon face heard their separate sounds they struck he looked forest bank stream saw individual trees leaves veining each leaf saw very insects upon them locusts brilliant bodied flies grey spiders stretching their webs from twig twig he noted prismatic colors dewdrops upon million blades grass humming gnats that danced above eddies stream beating dragon flies wings strokes water spiders legs like oars which lifted their boat these made audible music fish slid along beneath eyes he heard rush its body parting water he come surface facing down stream moment visible world seemed wheel slowly round himself pivotal point he saw bridge fort soldiers upon bridge captain sergeant two privates executioners they were silhouette against blue sky they shouted gesticulated pointing him captain drawn pistol but did not fire others were unarmed their movements were grotesque horrible their forms gigantic suddenly he heard sharp report something struck water smartly within few inches head spattering face with spray he heard second report saw one sentinels with rifle shoulder light cloud blue smoke rising from muzzle man water saw eye man bridge gazing into own through sights rifle he observed that it was grey eye remembered having read that grey eyes were keenest that famous marksmen them nevertheless this one missed counter swirl caught farquhar turned him half round he was again looking into forest bank opposite fort sound clear high voice monotonous singsong now rang out behind him came across water with distinctness that pierced subdued other sounds even beating ripples ears although soldier he frequented camps enough know dread significance that deliberate drawling aspirated chant lieutenant shore was taking part morning s work how coldly pitilessly with what an even calm intonation presaging enforcing tranquillity men with what accurately measured intervals fell those cruel words attention company shoulder arms ready aim fire farquhar dived dived deeply he could water roared ears like voice niagara yet he heard dulled thunder volley rising again toward surface met shining bits metal singularly flattened oscillating slowly downward some them touched him face hands then fell away continuing their descent one lodged between collar neck it was uncomfortably warm he snatched it out he rose surface gasping breath he saw that he been long time under water he was perceptibly farther down stream nearer safety soldiers almost finished reloading metal ramrods flashed sunshine they were drawn from barrels turned air thrust into their sockets two sentinels fired again independently ineffectually hunted man saw this over shoulder he was now swimming vigorously with current brain was energetic arms legs he thought with rapidity lightning officer he reasoned will not make that martinet s error second time it easy dodge volley single shot he probably already given command fire will god help me i cannot dodge them an appalling splash within two yards him was followed by loud rushing sound diminuendo which seemed travel back through air fort died an explosion which stirred very river its deeps rising sheet water curved over him fell down upon him blinded him strangled him cannon taken hand game he shook head free from commotion smitten water he heard deflected shot humming through air ahead an instant it was cracking smashing branches forest beyond they will not that again he thought next time they will use charge grape i must keep my eye upon gun smoke will apprise me report arrives too late it lags behind missile that good gun suddenly he felt himself whirled round round spinning like top water banks forests now distant bridge fort men were commingled blurred objects were represented by their colors only circular horizontal streaks color that was he saw he been caught vortex was being whirled with velocity advance gyration that made him giddy sick few moments he was flung upon gravel foot left bank stream southern bank behind projecting point which concealed him from enemies sudden arrest motion abrasion one hands gravel restored him he wept with delight he dug fingers into sand threw it over himself handfuls audibly blessed it it looked like diamonds rubies emeralds he could think nothing beautiful which it did not resemble trees upon bank were giant garden plants he noted definite order their arrangement inhaled fragrance their blooms strange roseate light shone through spaces among their trunks wind made their branches music olian harps he wish perfect escape was content remain that enchanting spot until retaken whiz rattle grapeshot among branches high above head roused him from dream baffled cannoneer fired him random farewell he sprang feet rushed sloping bank plunged into forest that day he traveled laying course by rounding sun forest seemed interminable nowhere did he discover break it not even woodman s road he not known that he lived so wild region there was something uncanny revelation by nightfall he was fatigued footsore famishing thought wife children urged him last he found road which led him what he knew right direction it was wide straight city street yet it seemed untraveled fields bordered it dwelling anywhere not so much barking dog suggested human habitation black bodies trees formed straight wall both sides terminating horizon point like diagram lesson perspective overhead he looked through this rift wood shone great garden stars looking unfamiliar grouped strange constellations he was sure they were arranged some order which secret malign significance wood either side was full singular noises among which twice again he distinctly heard whispers an unknown tongue neck was pain lifting hand it found it horribly swollen he knew that it circle black where rope bruised it eyes felt congested he could longer close them tongue was swollen with thirst he relieved its fever by thrusting it forward from between teeth into cold air how softly turf carpeted untraveled avenue he could longer feel roadway beneath feet doubtless despite suffering he fallen asleep while walking now he sees another scene perhaps he merely recovered from delirium he stands gate own home he left it bright beautiful morning sunshine he must traveled entire night he pushes open gate passes wide white walk he sees flutter female garments wife looking fresh cool sweet steps down from veranda meet him bottom steps she stands waiting with smile ineffable joy an attitude matchless grace dignity ah how beautiful she he springs forward with extended arms he about clasp he feels stunning blow upon back neck blinding white light blazes about him with sound like shock cannon then darkness silence peyton farquhar was dead body with broken neck swung gently from side side beneath timbers owl creek bridge
