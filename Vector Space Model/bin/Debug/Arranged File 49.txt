she remembered that children would there she took nothing except bottle smelling salts he rose somewhat ceremoniously from chair they exchanged slight bow sat down three boys with their tutor abbe martin were right three girls with miss smith their english governess were left youngest child who was only three months old remained upstairs with nurse abbe said grace usual when there was company children did not come down dinner when guests were present then they began dinner countess suffering from emotion which she not calculated upon remained with eyes cast down while count scrutinized now three boys now three girls with an uncertain unhappy expression which travelled from one other suddenly pushing wineglass from him it broke wine was spilt tablecloth slight noise caused by this little accident countess started from chair first time they looked each other then spite themselves spite irritation their nerves caused by every glance they continued exchange looks rapid pistol shots abbe who felt that there was some cause embarrassment which he could not divine attempted begin conversation tried various subjects but useless efforts gave rise ideas did not bring out word countess with feminine tact obeying instincts woman world attempted answer him two or three times but vain she could not find words perplexity mind own voice almost frightened silence large room where nothing was heard except slight sound plates knives forks suddenly husband said bending forward here amid your children will you swear me that what you told me just now true hatred which was fermenting veins

hesitation head my children i swear that i told you truth he got throwing table napkin table with movement exasperation he turned round flung chair against wall then went out without another word while she uttering deep sigh if after first victory went calm voice you must not pay any attention what your father just said my darlings he was very much upset short time ago but he will right again few days then she talked with abbe miss smith tender pretty words children those sweet tender mother s ways which unfold little hearts when dinner was over she went into drawing room children following she made elder ones chatter when their bedtime came she kissed them long time then went alone into room she waited she doubt that count would come she made mind then children were not with protect herself woman world she would protect life pocket dress she put little loaded revolver which she bought few days previously hours went by hours struck every sound was hushed house only cabs continued rumble through streets but their noise was only heard vaguely through shuttered curtained windows she waited full nervous energy without any fear him now ready anything almost triumphant she found means torturing him continually during every moment life but first gleam dawn came through fringe bottom curtain without having come into room then she awoke fact with much amazement that he was not coming having locked bolted door greater security she went bed last remained there with eyes open thinking barely understanding it without being able guess what he was going when maid brought tea she same time handed letter from husband he told that he was going undertake longish journey postscript added that lawyer would provide with any sums money she might require expenses iii it was opera between two acts robert devil stalls men were standing with their hats their waistcoats cut very low so show large amount white shirt front which gold jewelled studs glistened were looking boxes full ladies low dresses covered with diamonds pearls who were expanding like flowers that illuminated hothouse where beauty their faces whiteness their shoulders seemed bloom order gazed amid sound music human voices two friends with their backs orchestra were scanning those rows elegance that exhibition real or false charms jewels luxury pretension which displayed itself parts grand theatre one them roger de salnis said companion bernard grandin just look how beautiful comtesse de mascaret still older man turn looked through opera glasses tall lady box opposite she appeared still very young striking beauty seemed attract eyes every corner house pale complexion an ivory tint gave appearance statue while small diamond coronet glistened black hair like streak light when he looked some time bernard grandin replied with jocular accent sincere conviction you may well call beautiful how old you think she wait moment i tell you exactly i known since she was child i saw make debut into society when she was quite girl she she thirty thirty six impossible i sure it she looks twenty five she seven children it incredible what more they seven alive she very good mother i occasionally go house which very quiet pleasant one where one may see phenomenon family midst society how very strange there never been any reports about never but what about husband he peculiar he not yes very likely there been little drama between them one those little domestic dramas which one suspects never finds out exactly but guesses pretty closely what it i not know anything about it mascaret leads very fast life now after being model husband long he remained good spouse he shocking temper was crabbed easily took offence but since he been leading present wild life he become quite different but one might surmise that he some trouble worm gnawing somewhere he aged very much thereupon two friends talked philosophically some minutes about secret unknowable troubles which differences character or perhaps physical antipathies which were not perceived first give rise families then roger de salnis who was still looking madame de mascaret through opera glasses said it almost incredible that that woman seven children yes eleven years after which when she was thirty she refused any more order take place society which she seems likely many years poor women why you pity them why ah my dear fellow just consider eleven years condition motherhood such woman what hell youth beauty every hope success every poetical ideal brilliant life sacrificed that abominable law reproduction which turns normal woman into mere machine bringing children into world what would you it only nature yes but i say that nature our enemy that must always fight against nature she continually bringing us back an animal state you may sure that god not put anything this earth that clean pretty elegant or accessory our ideal human brain done it it man who introduced little grace beauty unknown charm mystery into creation by singing about it interpreting it by admiring it poet idealizing it an artist by explaining it through science doubtless making mistakes but finding ingenious reasons hidden grace beauty unknown charm mystery various phenomena nature god created only coarse beings full germs disease who after few years bestial enjoyment grow old infirm with ugliness want power human decrepitude he seems made them only order that they may reproduce their species an ignoble manner then die like ephemeral insects i said reproduce their species an ignoble manner i adhere that expression what there matter fact more ignoble more repugnant than that act reproduction living beings against which delicate minds always revolted always will revolt since organs which been invented by this economical malicious creator serve two purposes why did he not choose another method performing that sacred mission which noblest most exalted human functions mouth which nourishes body by means material food also diffuses abroad speech thought our flesh renews itself its own accord while thinking about it olfactory organs through which vital air reaches lungs communicate perfumes world brain smell flowers woods trees sea ear which enables us communicate with our fellow men also allowed us invent music create dreams happiness infinite even physical pleasure by means sound but one might say that cynical cunning creator wished prohibit man from ever ennobling idealizing intercourse with women nevertheless man found love which not bad reply that sly deity he adorned it with so much poetry that woman often forgets sensual part it those among us who unable deceive themselves invented vice refined debauchery which another way laughing god paying homage immodest homage beauty but normal man begets children just like an animal coupled with another by law look that woman it not abominable think that such jewel such pearl born beautiful admired feted adored spent eleven years life providing heirs comte de mascaret bernard grandin replied with laugh there great deal truth that but very few people would understand you salnis became more more animated you know how i picture god myself he said an enormous creative organ beyond our ken who scatters millions worlds into space just one single fish would deposit its spawn sea he creates because it function god so but he does not know what he doing stupidly prolific work ignorant combinations kinds which produced by scattered germs human mind lucky little local passing accident which was totally unforeseen condemned disappear with this earth recommence perhaps here or elsewhere same or different with fresh combinations eternally new beginnings owe it this little lapse intelligence part that very uncomfortable this world which was not made us which not been prepared receive us lodge feed us or satisfy reflecting beings owe it him also that struggle without ceasing against what still called designs providence when really refined civilized beings grandin who was listening him attentively he long known surprising outbursts imagination asked him then you believe that human thought spontaneous product blind divine generation naturally fortuitous function nerve centres our brain like unforeseen chemical action due new mixtures similar also charge electricity caused by friction or unexpected proximity some substance similar phenomena caused by infinite fruitful fermentation living matter but my dear fellow truth this must evident any one who looks about him if human mind ordained by an omniscient creator been intended what it become exacting inquiring agitated tormented so different from mere animal thought resignation would world which was created receive beings which now been this unpleasant little park small game this salad patch this wooded rocky spherical kitchen garden where your improvident providence destined us live naked caves or under trees nourished flesh slaughtered animals our brethren or raw vegetables nourished by sun rain but it sufficient reflect moment order understand that this world was not made such creatures thought which developed by miracle nerves cells our brain powerless ignorant confused it it will always remain makes us who intellectual beings eternal wretched exiles earth look this earth god given it those who inhabit it it not visibly solely made planted covered with forests sake animals what there us nothing them everything they nothing but eat or go hunting eat each other according their instincts god never foresaw gentleness peaceable manners he only foresaw death creatures which were bent destroying devouring each other not quail pigeon partridge natural prey hawk sheep stag ox that great flesh eating animals rather than meat fattened served us with truffles which been unearthed by pigs our special benefit ourselves more civilized intellectual refined more ought conquer subdue that animal instinct which represents will god us so order mitigate our lot brutes discovered made everything beginning with houses then exquisite food sauces sweetmeats pastry drink stuffs clothes ornaments beds mattresses carriages railways innumerable machines besides arts sciences writing poetry every ideal comes from us amenities life order make our existence simple reproducers which divine providence solely intended us less monotonous less hard look this theatre there not here human world created by us unforeseen unknown eternal fate intelligible our minds alone sensual intellectual distraction which been invented solely by that discontented restless little animal man look that woman madame de mascaret god intended live cave naked or wrapped skins wild animals but she not better she but speaking does any one know why how brute husband having such companion by side especially after having been boorish enough make mother seven times suddenly left run after bad women grandin replied oh my dear fellow this probably only reason he found that raising family was becoming too expensive from reasons domestic economy he arrived same principles which you lay down philosopher just then curtain rose third act they turned round took off their hats sat down iv comte comtesse mascaret were sitting side by side carriage which was taking them home from opera without speaking but suddenly husband said wife gabrielle what you want don t you think that this lasted long enough what horrible punishment which you condemned me last six years what you want i cannot help it then tell me which them it never think that i longer see my children or

terribly should i without that accepted horror living by your side still greater horror feeling knowing that there one among them whom i cannot recognize who prevents me from loving others then you really suffered very much she repeated he replied constrained sorrowful voice yes i not tell you every day that it intolerable torture me should i remained that house near you them if i did not love

lied before god i lied with my hand raised my children s head i never wronged you he seized arm darkness squeezing it he done that terrible day their drive bois de boulogne he stammered that true it true but wild with grief he said with groan i shall fresh doubts that will never end when did you lie last time or now how i believe you present how one believe woman after that i shall never again know what i think i would rather you said me it jacques or it jeanne carriage drove into courtyard house when it drawn front steps count alighted first usual offered wife arm mount stairs soon they reached first floor he said may i speak you few moments longer she replied i quite willing they went into small drawing room footman some surprise lighted wax candles soon he left room they were alone count continued how i know truth i begged you thousand times speak but you remained dumb impenetrable inflexible inexorable now day you tell me that you been lying six years you actually allowed me

replied i not feel that i mother children who never been born it enough me mother those that i love them with my heart i woman civilized world monsieur longer refuse mere females restock earth she got but he seized hands only one word gabrielle tell me truth i just told you i never dishonored you he looked full face how beautiful she was with gray eyes like cold sky dark hair sparkled diamond coronet like radiance he suddenly felt felt by kind intuition that this grand creature was not merely being destined perpetuate race but strange mysterious product our complicated desires which been accumulating us centuries but which been turned aside from their primitive divine object wandered after mystic imperfectly perceived intangible beauty there some women like that who blossom only our dreams adorned with every poetical attribute civilization with that ideal luxury coquetry esthetic charm which surround woman living statue that brightens our life husband remained standing before stupefied tardy obscure discovery confusedly hitting cause former jealousy understanding it very imperfectly last lie said i believe you i feel this moment that you not lying before i really thought that you were she put out hand him friends then he took hand kissed it replied friends thank you gabrielle then he went out still looking surprised that she was still so beautiful feeling strange emotion arising him
