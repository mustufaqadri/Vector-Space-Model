illustration story cat by author mary e wilkins freeman von grzanka felis catus cat snow 2010 snow was falling cat s fur was stiffly pointed with it but he was imperturbable he sat crouched ready death spring he sat hours it was night but that made difference times were one cat when he was wait prey then too he was under constraint human will he was living alone that winter nowhere world was any voice calling him hearth was there waiting dish he was quite free except own desires which tyrannized over him when unsatisfied now cat was very hungry almost famished fact days weather been very bitter feebler wild things which were prey by inheritance born serfs family kept most part their burrows nests cat s long hunt availed him nothing but he waited with inconceivable patience persistency race besides he was certain cat was creature absolute convictions faith deductions never wavered rabbit gone there between those low hung pine boughs now little doorway before it shaggy curtain snow but there she was cat seen enter so like swift grey shadow that even sharp practised eyes glanced back substance following then she was gone so he sat down waited he waited still white night listening angrily north wind starting upper heights mountains with distant screams then swelling into an awful crescendo rage swooping down with furious white wings snow like flock fierce eagles into valleys ravines cat was side mountain wooded terrace above him few feet away towered rock ascent steep wall cathedral cat never climbed it trees were ladders heights life he often looked with wonder rock miauled bitterly resentfully man does face forbidding providence left was sheer precipice behind him with short stretch woody growth between was frozen perpendicular wall mountain stream before him was way home when rabbit came out she was trapped little cloven feet could not scale such unbroken steeps so cat waited place which he was looked like maelstrom wood tangle trees bushes clinging mountain side with stern clutch roots prostrate trunks branches vines embracing everything with strong knots coils growth curious effect things which whirled ages current raging water only it was not water but wind which disposed everything circling lines yielding its fiercest points onset now over this whirl wood rock dead trunks branches vines descended snow it blew down like smoke over rock crest above it stood gyrating column like some death wraith nature level then it broke over edge precipice cat cowered before fierce backward set it it was if ice needles pricked skin through beautiful thick fur but he never faltered never cried he nothing gain from crying everything lose rabbit would hear him cry know he was waiting it grew darker darker with strange white smother instead natural blackness night it was night storm death superadded night nature mountains were hidden wrapped about overawed tumultuously overborne by it but midst it waited quite unconquered this little unswerving living patience power under little coat grey fur fiercer blast swept over rock spun one mighty foot whirlwind athwart level then was over precipice then cat saw two eyes luminous with terror frantic with impulse flight he saw little quivering dilating nose he saw two pointing ears he kept still with every one fine nerves muscles strained like wires then rabbit was out there was one long line incarnate flight terror cat then cat went home trailing prey through snow cat lived house which master built rudely child s block house but staunchly enough snow was heavy low slant its roof but it would not settle under it two windows door were made fast but cat knew way pine tree behind house he scuttled though it was hard work with heavy rabbit was little window under eaves then down through trap room below master s bed with spring great cry triumph rabbit but master was not there he been gone since early fall it was now february he would not return until spring he was an old man cruel cold mountains clutched vitals like panther he gone village winter cat known long time that master was gone but reasoning was always sequential circuitous always him what been would more easily marvellous waiting powers so he always came home expecting find master when he saw that he was still gone he dragged rabbit off rude couch which was bed floor put one little paw carcass keep it steady began gnawing with head one side bring strongest teeth bear it was darker house than it been wood cold was deadly though not so fierce if cat not received fur coat unquestioningly providence he would been thankful that he it it was mottled grey white face breast thick fur could grow wind drove snow windows with such force that it rattled like sleet house trembled little then cat heard noise stopped gnawing rabbit listened shining green eyes fixed upon window then he heard hoarse shout halloo despair entreaty but he knew it was not master come home he waited one paw still rabbit then halloo came again then cat answered he said that was essential quite plainly own comprehension there was cry response inquiry information warning terror finally offer comradeship but man outside did not hear him because howling storm then there was great battering pound door then another another cat dragged rabbit under bed blows came thicker faster it was weak arm which gave them but it was nerved by desperation finally lock yielded stranger came then cat peering from under bed blinked with sudden light green eyes narrowed stranger struck match looked about cat saw face wild blue with hunger cold man who looked poorer older than poor old master who was an outcast among men poverty lowly mystery antecedents he heard muttered unintelligible voicing distress from harsh piteous mouth there was it both profanity prayer but cat knew nothing that stranger braced door which he forced got some wood from stock corner kindled fire old stove quickly half frozen hands would allow he shook so pitiably he worked that cat under bed felt tremor it then man who was small feeble marked with scars suffering which he pulled down upon own head sat down one old chairs crouched over fire if it were one love desire soul holding out yellow hands like yellow claws he groaned cat came out from under bed leaped lap with rabbit man gave great shout start terror sprang cat slid clawing floor rabbit fell inertly man leaned gasping with fright ghastly against wall cat grabbed rabbit by slack its neck dragged it man s feet then he raised shrill insistent cry he arched back high tail was splendid waving plume he rubbed against man s feet which were bursting out their torn shoes man pushed cat away gently enough began searching about little cabin he even climbed painfully ladder loft lit match peered darkness with straining eyes he feared lest there might man since there was cat experience with men not been pleasant neither experience men been pleasant with him he was an old wandering ishmael among kind he stumbled upon house brother brother was not home he was glad he returned cat stooped stiffly stroked back which animal arched like spring bow then he took rabbit looked it eagerly by firelight jaws worked he could almost devoured it raw he fumbled cat close heels around some rude shelves table found with grunt self gratulation lamp with oil it that he lighted then he found frying pan knife skinned rabbit prepared it cooking cat always feet when odour cooking flesh filled cabin both man cat looked wolfish man turned rabbit with one hand stooped pat cat with other cat thought him fine man he loved him with heart though he known him such short time though man face both pitiful sharply set variance with best things it was face with grimy grizzle age upon it with fever hollows cheeks memories wrong dim eyes but cat accepted man unquestioningly loved him when rabbit was half cooked neither man nor cat could wait any longer man took it from fire divided it exactly halves gave cat one took other himself then they ate then man blew out light called cat him got bed drew ragged coverings fell asleep with cat bosom man was cat s guest rest winter winter long mountains rightful owner little hut did not return until may that time cat toiled hard he grew rather thin himself he shared everything except mice with guest sometimes game was wary fruit patience days was very little two man was ill weak however unable eat much which was fortunate since he could not hunt himself day long he lay bed or else sat crouched over fire it was good thing that fire wood was ready hand picking not stone s throw from door that he attend himself cat foraged tirelessly sometimes he was gone days together first man used terrified thinking he would never return then he would hear familiar cry door stumble feet let him then two would dine together sharing equally then cat would rest purr finally sleep man s arms towards spring game grew plentiful more wild little quarry were tempted out their homes search love well food one day cat luck rabbit partridge mouse he could not carry them but finally he them together house door then he cried but one answered mountain streams were loosened air was full gurgle many waters occasionally pierced by bird whistle trees rustled with new sound spring wind there was flush rose gold green breasting surface distant mountain seen through an opening wood tips bushes were swollen glistening red now then there was flower but cat nothing with flowers he stood beside booty house door cried cried with insistent triumph complaint pleading but one came let him then cat left little treasures door went around back house pine tree was trunk with wild scramble through little window down through trap room man was gone cat cried again that cry animal human companionship which one sad notes world he looked corners he sprang chair window looked out but one came man was gone he never came again cat ate mouse out turf beside house rabbit partridge he carried painfully into house but man did not come share them finally course day or two he ate them himself then he slept long time bed when he waked man was not there then cat went forth hunting grounds again came home night with plump bird reasoning with tireless persistency expectancy that man would there there was light window when he cried old master opened door let him master strong comradeship with cat but not affection he never patted him like that gentler outcast but he pride him an anxiety welfare though he left him alone winter without scruple he feared lest some misfortune might come cat though he was so large kind mighty hunter therefore when he saw him door glory glossy winter coat white breast face shining like snow sun own face lit with welcome cat embraced feet with sinuous body vibrant with rejoicing purrs cat bird himself master own supper already cooking stove after supper cat s master took pipe sought small store tobacco which he left hut over winter he thought often it that cat seemed something come home spring but tobacco was gone not dust left man swore little grim monotone which made profanity lose its customary effect he been was hard drinker he knocked about world until marks its sharp corners were very soul which was thereby calloused until very sensibility loss was dulled he was very old man he searched tobacco with sort dull combativeness persistency then he stared with stupid wonder around room suddenly many features struck him being changed another stove lid was broken an old piece carpet was tacked over window keep out cold fire wood was gone he looked there was oil left he looked coverings bed he took them again he made that strange remonstrant noise throat then he looked again tobacco finally he gave it he sat down beside fire may mountains cold he held empty pipe mouth rough forehead knitted he cat looked each other across that impassable barrier silence which been set between man beast from creation world
