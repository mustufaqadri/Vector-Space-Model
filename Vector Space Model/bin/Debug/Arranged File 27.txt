bet by anton pavlovich chekhov 1860 1904 it was dark autumn night old banker was walking down study remembering how fifteen years before he given party one autumn evening there been many clever men there there been interesting conversations among other things they talked capital punishment majority guests among whom were many journalists intellectual men disapproved death penalty they considered that form punishment out date immoral unsuitable christian states opinion some them death penalty ought replaced everywhere by imprisonment life i don t agree with you said their host banker i not tried either death penalty or imprisonment life but if one may judge priori_ death penalty more moral more humane than imprisonment life capital punishment kills man but lifelong imprisonment kills him slowly which executioner more humane he who kills you few minutes or he who drags life out you course many years both equally immoral observed one guests they both same object take away life state not god it not right take away what it cannot restore when it wants among guests was young lawyer young man five twenty when he was asked opinion he said death sentence life sentence equally immoral but if i choose between death penalty imprisonment life i would certainly choose second live anyhow better than not lively discussion arose banker who was younger more nervous those days was suddenly carried away by excitement he struck table with fist shouted young man it s not true i ll bet you two millions you wouldn t stay solitary confinement five years if you mean that earnest said young man i ll take bet but i would stay not five but fifteen years fifteen done cried banker gentlemen i stake two millions agreed you stake your millions i stake my freedom said young man this wild senseless bet was carried out banker spoilt frivolous with millions beyond reckoning was delighted bet supper he made fun young man said think better it young man while there still time me two millions trifle but you losing three or four best years your life i say three or four because you won t stay longer don t forget either you unhappy man that voluntary confinement great deal harder bear than compulsory thought that you right step out liberty any moment will poison your whole existence prison i sorry you now banker walking fro remembered this asked himself what was object that bet what good that man s losing fifteen years life my throwing away two millions it prove that death penalty better or worse than imprisonment life it was nonsensical meaningless my part it was caprice pampered man part simple greed money then he remembered what followed that evening it was decided that young man should spend years captivity under strictest supervision one lodges banker s garden it

lodge stood he twice called watchman answer followed evidently watchman sought shelter from weather was now asleep somewhere either kitchen or greenhouse if i pluck carry out my intention thought old man suspicion would fall first upon watchman he felt darkness steps door went into entry lodge then he groped way into little passage lighted match there was not soul there there was bedstead with bedding it corner there was dark cast iron stove seals door leading prisoner s rooms were intact when match went out old man trembling with emotion peeped through little window candle was burning dimly prisoner s room he was sitting table nothing could seen but back hair head hands open books were lying table two easy chairs carpet near table five minutes passed prisoner did not stir fifteen years imprisonment taught him sit still banker tapped window with finger prisoner made movement whatever response then banker cautiously broke seals off door put key keyhole rusty lock gave grating sound door creaked banker expected hear footsteps cry astonishment but three minutes passed it was quiet ever room he made mind go table man unlike ordinary people was sitting motionless he was skeleton with skin drawn tight over bones with long curls like woman s shaggy beard face was yellow with an earthy tint it cheeks were hollow back long narrow hand which shaggy head was propped was so thin delicate that it was dreadful look it hair was already streaked with silver seeing emaciated aged looking face one would believed that he was only forty he was asleep front bowed head there lay table sheet paper which there was something written fine handwriting poor creature thought banker he asleep most likely dreaming millions i only take this half dead man throw him bed stifle him little with pillow most conscientious expert would find sign violent death but let us first read what he written here banker took page from table read follows morrow twelve o clock i regain my freedom right associate with other men but before i leave this room see sunshine i think it necessary say few words you with clear conscience i tell you before god who beholds me that i despise freedom life health that your books called good things world fifteen years i been intently studying earthly life it true i not seen earth nor men but your books i drunk fragrant wine i sung songs i hunted stags wild boars forests loved women beauties ethereal clouds created by magic your poets geniuses visited me night whispered my ears wonderful tales that set my brain whirl your books i climbed peaks elburz mont blanc from there i seen sun rise watched it evening flood sky ocean mountain tops with gold crimson i watched from there lightning flashing over my head cleaving storm clouds i seen green forests fields rivers lakes towns i heard singing sirens strains shepherds pipes i touched wings comely devils who flew down converse with me god your books i flung myself into bottomless pit performed miracles slain burned towns preached new religions conquered whole kingdoms your books given me wisdom that unresting thought man created ages compressed into small compass my brain i know that i wiser than you i despise your books i despise wisdom blessings this world it worthless fleeting illusory deceptive like mirage you may proud wise fine but death will wipe you off face earth though you were more than mice burrowing under floor your posterity your history your immortal geniuses will burn or freeze together with earthly globe you lost your reason taken wrong path you taken lies truth hideousness beauty you would marvel if owing strange events some sorts frogs lizards suddenly grew apple orange trees instead fruit or if roses began smell like sweating horse so i marvel you who exchange heaven earth i don t want understand you prove you action how i despise that you live by i renounce two millions which i dreamed paradise which now i despise deprive myself right money i
