school story by m r james two men smoking room were talking their private school days our school said ghost s footmark staircase what was it like oh very unconvincing just shape shoe with square toe if i remember right staircase was stone one i never heard any story about thing that seems odd when you come think it why didn t somebody invent one i wonder you never tell with little boys they mythology their own there s subject you by way folklore private schools yes crop rather scanty though i imagine if you were investigate cycle ghost stories instance which boys private schools tell each other they would turn out highly compressed versions stories out books nowadays strand pearson s so would extensively drawn upon doubt they weren t born or thought my time let s see i wonder if i remember staple ones that i was told first there was house with room which series people insisted passing night each them morning was found kneeling corner just time say i ve seen it died wasn t that house berkeley square i dare say it was then there was man who heard noise passage night opened door saw someone crawling towards him fours with eye hanging out cheek there was besides let me think yes room where man was found dead bed with horseshoe mark forehead floor under bed was covered with marks horseshoes also i don t know why also there was lady who locking bedroom door strange house heard thin voice among bed curtains say now re shut night none those any explanation or sequel i wonder if they go still those stories oh likely enough with additions from magazines i said you never heard did you real ghost private school i thought not nobody that ever i came across from way which you said that i gather that you i really don t know but this what was my mind it happened my private school thirty odd years ago i haven t any explanation it school i mean was near london it was established large fairly old house great white building with very fine grounds about it there were large cedars garden there so many older gardens thames valley ancient elms three or four fields which used our games i think probably it was quite an attractive place but boys seldom allow that their schools possess any tolerable features i came school september soon after year 1870 among boys who arrived same day was one whom i took highland boy whom i will call mcleod i needn t spend time describing him main thing that i got know him very well he was not an exceptional boy any way not particularly good books or games but he suited me school was large one there must been from 120 130 boys there rule so considerable staff masters was required there were rather frequent changes among them one term perhaps it was my third or fourth new master made appearance name was sampson he was tallish stoutish pale black bearded man i think liked him he travelled good deal stories which amused us our school walks so that there was some competition among us get within earshot him i remember too dear me i hardly thought it since then that he charm watch chain that attracted my attention one day he let me examine it it was i now suppose gold byzantine coin there was an effigy some absurd emperor one side other side been worn practically smooth he cut it rather barbarously own initials g w s date 24 july 1865 yes i see it now he told me he picked it constantinople it was about size florin perhaps rather smaller well first odd thing that happened was this sampson was doing latin grammar with us one favourite methods perhaps it rather good one was make us construct sentences out our own heads illustrate rules he was trying make us learn course that thing which gives silly boy chance being impertinent there lots school stories which that happens or anyhow there might but sampson was too good disciplinarian us think trying that with him now this occasion he was telling us how express remembering latin he ordered us each make sentence bringing verb memini i remember well most us made some ordinary sentence such i remember my father or he remembers book or something equally uninteresting i dare say good many put down memino librum meum so forth but boy i mentioned mcleod was evidently thinking something more elaborate than that rest us wanted our sentences passed get something else so some kicked him under desk i who was next him poked him whispered him look sharp but he didn t seem attend i looked paper saw he put down nothing so i jogged him again harder than before upbraided him sharply keeping us waiting that did some effect he started seemed wake then very quickly he scribbled about couple lines paper showed it with rest it was last or nearly last come sampson good deal say boys who written meminiscimus patri meo rest it it turned out that clock struck twelve before he got mcleod mcleod wait afterwards sentence corrected there was nothing much going outside when i got out so i waited him come he came very slowly when he did arrive i guessed there been some sort trouble well i said what did you get oh i don t know said mcleod nothing much but i think sampson s rather sick with me why did you show him some rot fear he said it was right far i could see it was like this memento that s right enough remember it takes genitive memento putei inter quatuor taxos what silly rot i said what made you shove that down what does it mean that s funny part said mcleod i m not quite sure what it does mean i know it just came into my head i corked it down i know what i think it means because just before i wrote it down i sort picture it my head i believe it means remember well among four what those dark sort trees that red berries them mountain ashes i s pose you mean i never heard them said mcleod i ll tell you yews well what did sampson say why he was jolly odd about it when he read it he got went mantelpiece stopped quite long time without saying anything with back me then he said without turning round rather quiet what you suppose that means i told him what i thought only i couldn t remember name silly tree then he wanted know why i put it down i say something or other after that he left off talking about it asked me how long i d been here where my people lived things like that then i came away but he wasn t looking bit well i don t remember any more that was said by either us about this next day mcleod took bed with chill or something kind it was week or more before he was school again much month went by without anything happening that was noticeable whether or not mr sampson was really startled mcleod thought he didn t show it i pretty sure course now that there was something very curious past history but i m not going pretend that boys were sharp enough guess any such thing there was one other incident same kind last which i told you several times since that day make examples school illustrate different rules but there never been any row except when did them wrong last there came day when were going through those dismal things which people call conditional sentences were told make conditional sentence expressing future consequence did it right or wrong showed our bits paper sampson began looking through them he got made some odd sort noise throat rushed out by door that was just by desk sat there minute or two then i suppose it was incorrect but went i one or two others look papers desk course i thought someone must put down some nonsense or other sampson gone off report him same i noticed that he hadn t taken any papers with him when he ran out well top paper desk was written red ink which one used it wasn t anyone s hand who was class they looked it mcleod took their dying oaths that it wasn t theirs then i thought counting bits paper this i made quite certain that there were seventeen bits paper desk sixteen boys form well i bagged extra paper kept it i believe i it now now you will want know what was written it it was simple enough harmless enough i should said si tu non veneris ad me ego veniam ad te which means i suppose if you don t come me i ll come you could you show me paper interrupted listener yes i could but there s another odd thing about it that same afternoon i took it out my locker i know certain it was same bit i made finger mark it single trace writing any kind was there it i kept it i said since that time i tried various experiments see whether sympathetic ink been used but absolutely without result so much that after about half an hour sampson looked again said he felt very unwell told us might go he came rather gingerly desk gave just one look uppermost paper i suppose he thought he must been dreaming anyhow he asked questions that day was half holiday next day sampson was school again much usual that night third last incident my story happened mcleod i slept dormitory right angles main building sampson slept main building first floor there was very bright full moon an hour which i t tell exactly but some time between one two i was woken by somebody shaking me it was mcleod nice state mind he seemed come he said come there s burglar getting through sampson s window soon i could speak i said well why not call out wake everybody he said i m not sure who it don t make row come look naturally i came looked naturally there was one there i was cross enough should called mcleod plenty names only i couldn t tell why it seemed me that there was something wrong something that made me very glad i wasn t alone face it were still window looking out soon i could i asked him what he heard or seen i didn t hear anything he said but about five minutes before i woke you i found myself looking out this window here there was man sitting or kneeling sampson s window sill looking i thought he was beckoning what sort man mcleod wriggled i don t know he said but i tell you one thing he was beastly thin he looked if he was wet over he said looking round whispering if he hardly liked hear himself i m not sure that he was alive went talking whispers some time longer eventually crept back bed one else room woke or stirred whole time i believe did sleep bit afterwards but were very cheap next day next day mr sampson was gone not found i believe trace him ever come light since thinking it over one oddest things about it seemed me fact that neither mcleod nor i ever mentioned what seen any third person whatever course questions were asked subject if they been i inclined believe that could not made any answer seemed unable speak about it that my story said narrator only approach ghost story connected with school that i know but still i think an approach such thing sequel this may perhaps reckoned highly conventional but sequel there so it must produced there been more than one listener story latter part that same year or next one such listener was staying country house ireland one evening host was turning over drawer full odds ends smoking room suddenly he put hand upon little box now he said you know about old things tell me what that my friend opened little box found it thin gold chain with an object attached it he glanced object then took off spectacles examine it more narrowly what s history this he asked odd enough was answer you know yew thicket shrubbery well year or two back were cleaning out old well that used clearing here what you suppose found it possible that you found body said visitor with an odd feeling nervousness did that but what s more every sense word found two good heavens two was there anything show how they got there was this thing found with them it was amongst rags clothes that were one bodies bad business whatever story it may been one body arms tight round other they must been there thirty years or more long enough before came this place you may judge filled well fast enough you make anything what s cut that gold coin you there i think i said my friend holding it light but he read it without much difficulty it seems g w s
