bath then he saw sun shining engine cowling machine he saw rivets metal he remembered where he was he realized that he was longer feeling good that he was sick giddy head kept falling forward onto chest because neck seemed longer any strength but he knew that he was flying spitfire he could feel handle stick between fingers right hand i m going pass out he thought any moment now i m going pass out he looked altimeter twenty one thousand test himself he tried read hundreds well thousands twenty one thousand what he looked dial became blurred he could not even see needle he knew then that he must bail out that there was not second lose otherwise he would become unconscious quickly frantically he tried slide back hood with left hand but he not strength second he took right hand off stick with both hands he managed push hood back rush cold air face seemed help he moment great clearness actions became orderly precise that what happens with good pilot he took some quick deep breaths from oxygen mask he did so he looked out over side cockpit down below there was only vast white sea cloud he realized that he did not know where he was it ll channel he thought i m sure fall drink he throttled back pulled off helmet undid straps pushed stick hard over left spitfire dripped its port wing turned smoothly over onto its back pilot fell out he fell he opened eyes because he knew that he must not pass out before he pulled cord one side he saw sun other he saw whiteness clouds he fell he somersaulted air white clouds chased sun sun chased clouds they chased each other small circle they ran faster faster there was sun clouds clouds sun clouds came nearer until suddenly there was longer any sun but only great whiteness whole world was white there was nothing it it was so white that sometimes it looked black after time it was either white or black but mostly it was white he watched it it turned from white black then back white again white stayed long time but black lasted only few seconds he got into habit going sleep during white periods waking just time see world when it was black but black was very quick sometimes it was only flash like someone switching off light switching it again so whenever it was white he dozed off one day when it was white he put out hand he touched something he took it between fingers crumpled it time he lay there idly letting tips fingers play with thing which they touched then slowly he opened eyes looked down hand saw that he was holding something which was white it was edge sheet he knew it was sheet because he could see texture material stitchings hem he screwed eyes opened them again quickly this time he saw room he saw bed which he was lying he saw grey walls door green curtains over window there were some roses table by bed then he saw basin table near roses it was white enamel basin beside it there was small medicine glass this hospital he thought i hospital but he could remember nothing he lay back pillow looking ceiling wondering what happened he was gazing smooth greyness ceiling which was so clean gray then suddenly he saw fly walking upon it sight this fly suddenness seeing this small black speck sea gray brushed surface brain quickly that second he remembered everything he remembered spitfire he remembered altimeter showing twenty one thousand feet he remembered pushing back hood with both hands he remembered bailing out he remembered leg it seemed right now he looked down end bed but he could not tell he put one hand underneath bedclothes felt knees he found one them but when he felt other hand touched something which was soft covered bandages just then door opened nurse came hello she said so you ve waked last she was not good looking but she was large clean she was between thirty forty she fair hair more than that he did not notice where i you re lucky fellow you landed wood near beach you re brighton they brought you two days ago now you re fixed you look fine i ve lost leg he said that s nothing ll get you another one now you must go sleep doctor will coming see you about an hour she picked basin medicine glass went out but he did not sleep he wanted keep eyes open because he was frightened that if he shut them again everything would go away he lay looking ceiling fly was still there it was very energetic it would run forward very fast few inches then it would stop then it would run forward again stop run forward stop every now then it would take off buzz around viciously small circles it always landed back same place ceiling started running stopping over again he watched it so long that after while it was longer fly but only black speck upon sea gray he was still watching it when nurse opened door stood aside while doctor came he was an army doctor major he some last war ribbons chest he was bald small but he cheerful face kind eyes well well he said so you ve decided wake last how you feeling i feel right that s stuff you ll about time doctor took wrist feel pulse by way he said some lads from your squadron were ringing asking about you they wanted come along see you but i said that they d better wait day or two told them you were right that they could come see you little later just lie quiet take it easy bit got something read he glanced table with roses well nurse will look after you she ll get you anything you want with that he waved hand went out followed by large clean nurse when they gone he lay back looked ceiling again fly was still there he lay watching it he heard noise an airplane distance he lay listening sound its engines it was long way away i wonder what it he thought let me see if i place it suddenly he jerked head sharply one side anyone who been bombed tell noise junkers 88 they tell most other german bombers that matter but especially junkers 88 engines seem sing duet there deep vibrating bass voice with it there high pitched tenor it singing tenor which makes sound ju 88 something which one cannot mistake he lay listening noise he felt quite certain about what it was but where were sirens where guns that german pilot certainly nerve coming near brighton alone daylight aircraft was always far away soon noise faded away into distance later there was another this one too was far away but there was same deep undulating bass high singing tenor there was mistaking it he heard that noise every day during battle he was puzzled there was bell table by bed he reached out hand rang it he heard noise footsteps down corridor nurse came nurse what were those airplanes i m sure i don t know i didn t hear them probably fighters or bombers i expect they were returning from france why what s matter they were ju 88 s i m sure they were ju 88 s i know sound engines there were two them what were they doing over here nurse came side bed began straighten out sheets tuck them under mattress gracious me what things you imagine you mustn t worry about thing like that would you like me get you something read thank you she patted pillow brushed back hair from forehead with hand they never come over daylight any longer you know that they were probably lancasters or flying fortresses nurse yes could i cigarette why certainly you she went out came back almost with packet players some matches she handed one him when he put it mouth she struck match lit it if you want me again she said just ring bell she went out toward evening he heard noise another aircraft it was far away but even so he knew that it was single engined machine but he could not place it it was going fast he could tell that but it wasn t spit it wasn t hurricane fighter air craft it did not sound like an american engine either they make more noise he did not know what it was it worried him greatly perhaps i very ill he thought perhaps i imagining things perhaps i little delirious i simply not know what think that evening nurse came with basin hot water began wash him well she said i hope you don t still think that re being bombed she taken off pajama top was soaping right arm with flannel he did not answer she rinsed flannel water rubbed more soap it began wash chest you re looking fine this evening she said they operated you soon you came they did marvelous job you ll right i ve got brother raf she added flying bombers he said i went school brighton she looked quickly well that s fine she said i expect you ll know some people town yes he said i know quite few she finished washing chest arms now she turned back bedclothes so that left leg was uncovered she did it such way that bandaged stump remained under sheets she undid cord pajama trousers took them off there was trouble because they cut off right trouser leg so that it could not interfere with bandages she began wash left leg rest body this was first time he bed bath he was embarrassed she laid towel under leg she was washing foot with flannel she said this wretched soap won t lather it s water it s hard nails he said none soap very good now course with hard water it s hopeless he said it he remembered something he remembered baths which he used take school brighton long stone floored bathroom which four baths room he remembered how water was so soft that you take shower afterwards get soap off your body he remembered how foam used float surface water so that you could not see your legs underneath he remembered that sometimes they were given calcium tablets because school doctor used say that soft water was bad teeth brighton he said water isn t he did not finish sentence something occurred him something so fantastic absurd that moment he felt like telling nurse about it having good laugh she looked water isn t what she said nothing he answered i was dreaming she rinsed flannel basin wiped soap off leg dried him with towel it s nice washed he said i feel better he was feeling face with hands i need shave ll that tomorrow she said perhaps you it yourself then that night he could not sleep he lay awake thinking junkers 88 s hardness water he could think nothing else they were ju 88 s he said himself i know they were yet it not possible because they would not flying around so low over here broad daylight i know that it true yet i know that it impossible perhaps i ill perhaps i behaving like fool not know what i doing or saying perhaps i delirious long time he lay awake thinking these things he sat bed said aloud i will prove that i not crazy i will make little speech about something complicated intellectual i will talk about what with germany after war but before he time begin he was asleep he woke just first light day was showing through slit curtains over window room was still dark but he could tell that it was already beginning get light outside he lay looking grey light which was showing through slit curtain he lay there he remembered day before he remembered junkers 88 s hardness water he remembered large pleasant nurse kind doctor now small grain doubt took root mind it began grow he looked around room nurse taken roses out night before there was nothing except table with packet cigarettes box matches an ash tray otherwise it was bare it was longer warm or friendly it was not even comfortable it was cold empty very quiet slowly grain doubt grew with it came fear light dancing fear that warned but did not frighten kind fear that one gets not because one afraid but because one feels that there something wrong quickly doubt fear grew so that he became restless angry when he touched forehead with hand he found that it was damp with sweat he knew then that he must something that he must find some way proving himself that he was either right or wrong he looked saw again window green curtains from where he lay that window was right front him but it was fully ten yards away somehow he must reach it look out idea became an obsession with him soon he could think nothing except window but what about leg he put hand underneath bedclothes felt thick bandaged stump which was that was left right hand side it seemed right it didn t hurt but it would not easy he sat then he pushed bedclothes aside put left leg floor slowly carefully he swung body over until he both hands floor well then he was out bed kneeling carpet he looked stump it was very short thick covered with bandages it was beginning hurt he could feel it throbbing he wanted collapse lie down carpet nothing but he knew that he must go with two arms one leg he crawled over towards window he would reach forward far he could with arms then he would give little jump slide left leg along after them each time he did it jarred wound so that he gave soft grunt pain but he continued crawl across floor two hands one knee when he got window he reached one time he placed both hands sill slowly he raised himself until he was standing left leg then quickly he pushed aside curtains looked out he saw small house with gray tiled roof standing alone beside narrow lane immediately behind it there was plowed field front house there was an untidy garden there was green hedge separating garden from lane he was looking hedge when he saw sign it was just piece board nailed top short pole because hedge not been trimmed long time branches grown out around sign so that it seemed almost though it been placed middle hedge there was something written board with white paint he pressed head against glass window trying read what it said first letter was g he could see that second was an third was an r one after another he managed see what letters were there were three words slowly he spelled letters out aloud himself he managed read them g r d e u c h i e n garde au chien that what it said he stood there balancing one leg holding tightly edges window sill with hands staring sign whitewashed lettering words moment he could think nothing he stood there looking sign repeating words over over himself then slowly he began realize full meaning thing he looked cottage plowed field he looked small orchard left cottage he looked green countryside beyond so this france he said i france now throbbing right thigh was very great it felt though someone was pounding end stump with hammer suddenly pain became so intense that it affected head moment he thought he was going fall quickly he knelt down again crawled back bed hoisted himself he pulled bedclothes over himself lay back pillow exhausted he could still think nothing except small sign by hedge plowed field orchard it was words sign that he could not forget it was some time before nurse came she came carrying basin hot water she said good morning how you today he said good morning nurse pain was still great under bandages but he did not wish tell this woman anything he looked she busied herself with getting washing things ready he looked more carefully now hair was very fair she was tall big boned face seemed pleasant but there was something little uneasy about eyes they were never still they never looked anything more than moment they moved too quickly from one place another room there was something about movements also they were too sharp nervous go well with casual manner which she spoke she set down basin took off pajama top began wash him did you sleep well yes good she said she was washing arms chest i believe there s someone coming down see you from air ministry after breakfast she went they want report or something i expect you know about it how you got shot down that i won t let him stay long so don t worry he did not answer she finished washing
