now arrived march 24 1812 it was day curious experiences stephen windy noisy day which filled house gardens with restless impression stephen stood by fence grounds looked out into park he felt if an endless procession unseen people were sweeping past him wind borne resistlessly aimlessly vainly striving stop themselves catch something that might arrest their flight bring them again into contact with living world which they formed part after luncheon that day mr abney said stephen my boy you think you could manage come me tonight late eleven o clock my study i shall busy until that time i

before fire an old silver gilt cup stood table filled with red wine some written sheets paper lay near it mr abney was sprinkling some incense brazier from round silver box stephen passed but did not seem notice step wind fallen there was still night full moon about ten o clock stephen was standing open window bedroom looking out over country still night was mysterious population distant moon lit woods was not yet lulled rest from time time strange cries lost despairing wanderers sounded from across mere they might notes owls or water birds yet they did not quite resemble either sound were not they coming nearer now they sounded from nearer side water few moments they seemed floating about among shrubberies then they ceased but just stephen was thinking shutting window resuming reading robinson crusoe he caught sight two figures standing gravelled terrace that ran along garden side hall figures boy girl it seemed they stood side by side looking windows something form girl recalled irresistibly dream figure bath boy inspired him with more acute fear whilst girl stood still half smiling with hands clasped over heart boy thin shape with black hair ragged clothing raised arms air with an appearance menace unappeasable hunger longing moon shone upon almost transparent hands stephen saw that nails were fearfully long that light shone through them he stood with arms thus raised he disclosed terrifying spectacle left side chest there opened black gaping rent there fell upon stephen s brain rather than upon ear impression one those hungry desolate cries that he heard resounding over woods aswarby that evening another moment this dreadful pair moved swiftly noiselessly over dry gravel he saw them more inexpressibly frightened he was he determined take candle go down mr abney s study hour appointed their meeting was near hand study or library opened out front hall one side stephen urged by terrors did not take long getting there effect an entrance was not so easy it was not locked he felt sure key was outside door usual repeated knocks produced answer mr abney was engaged he was speaking what why did he try cry out why was cry choked throat he too seen mysterious children but now everything was quiet door yielded stephen s terrified frantic pushing table mr abney s study certain papers were found which explained situation stephen elliott when he was an age understand them most important sentences were follows it was belief very strongly generally held by ancients whose wisdom these matters i such experience induces me place confidence their assertions that by enacting certain processes which us moderns something barbaric complexion very remarkable enlightenment spiritual faculties man may attained that example by absorbing personalities certain number fellow creatures an individual may gain complete ascendancy over those orders spiritual beings which control elemental forces our universe it recorded simon magus that he was able fly air become invisible or assume any form he pleased by agency soul boy whom use libellous phrase employed by author clementine recognitions he murdered i find it set down moreover with considerable detail writings hermes trismegistus that similar happy results may produced by absorption hearts not less than three human beings below age twenty one years testing truth this receipt i devoted
