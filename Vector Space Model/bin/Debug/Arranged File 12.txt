it crept onward among ruinous houses over twinkling river westland row station crowd people pressed carriage doors but porters moved them back saying that it was special train bazaar i remained alone bare carriage few minutes train drew beside an improvised wooden platform i passed out road saw by lighted dial clock that it was ten minutes ten front me was large building which displayed magical name i could not find any sixpenny entrance fearing that bazaar would closed i passed quickly through turnstile handing shilling weary looking man i found myself big hall girded half its height by gallery nearly stalls were closed greater part hall was darkness i recognized silence like that which pervades church after service i walked into centre bazaar timidly few people were gathered about stalls which were still open before curtain over which words caf chantant were written coloured lamps two men were counting money salver i listened fall coins remembering with difficulty why i come i went over one stalls examined porcelain vases flowered tea sets door stall young lady was talking laughing with two young gentlemen i remarked their english accents listened vaguely their conversation o i never said such thing o but you did o but i didn t didn t she say that yes i heard o there s fib observing me young lady came over asked me did i wish buy anything tone voice was not encouraging she seemed spoken me out sense duty i looked humbly great jars that stood like eastern guards either side dark entrance stall murmured thank you young lady changed position one vases went back two young men they began talk same subject or twice young lady glanced me over shoulder i lingered before stall though i knew my stay was useless make my interest wares seem more real then i turned away slowly walked down middle bazaar i allowed two pennies fall against sixpence my pocket i heard voice call from one end gallery that light was out upper part hall was now completely dark gazing into darkness i saw myself creature driven derided by vanity my eyes burned with anguish anger
